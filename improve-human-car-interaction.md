year: 1992
caption: Driving is already a complex task that demands a varying level of cognitive and physical load. With the advancement in technology, the car has become a place for media consumption, a communications center and an interconnected workplace. The number of features in a car has also increased. As a result, the user interaction inside the car has become overcrowded and more complex. Human Car Interaction is an active area of research at Arizona State University which aims at understanding this interaction and making it simpler and safer for drivers.
